        About the Project
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Covid-19 pandemic was the first of its kind because of the modern capabilities to collect and disseminate information and data at rapid rates. Because of this, there is public interest in looking at the data and doing their own research. The visuals that have been created throughout the pandemic to represent this data have created confusion because they are misleading or too technical for the general public. The goal of this project is to create a visual representation of the most prominent Covid-19 variants that both scientists and the public can understand in order to increase public acknowledgement of the virusâ€™ rapid mutation rates.
